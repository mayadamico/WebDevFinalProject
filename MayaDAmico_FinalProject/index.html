    <p>Searching for a therapist can be a difficult and overwhelming process. Taking this step and setting up an initial therapy appointment can be terrifying, so let me tell you what you can expect if we decide to work together. Maybe you're grieving a loss, struggling with a life transition, or feeling in a rut. Together, we can build up your skills to better understand and manage distressing feelings and the challenges that are currently weighing you down.</span>

Together, our work will be strength-based & solution-focused. Utilizing a combination of eclectic and traditional treatment modalities, we will work toward your goals. </p>
